**CONTEXT**
Rocket League trading is essentially a virtual economy within the game Rocket League, a popular car soccer game. Players can acquire in-game items like car bodies, wheels, and decals, which can be customized to personalize their vehicles. This is completely within the game's TOS

These items have varying degrees of rarity and desirability, much like collectibles in the real world. Players can trade these items with each other, either directly or through third-party marketplaces. The value of these items fluctuates based on demand, supply, and recent in-game events.

This trading economy has grown into a significant community, with players engaging in complex trades, investing time and effort to acquire rare items. It's similar to stock trading in a way, where players analyze market trends, make strategic decisions, and aim to maximize the value of their virtual assets.

The site https://rocket-league.com/ used to be one of the popular sites player use to find other players to trade however the code no longer works as the site removed the trading page from the site due to the main game Rocket League removing the trading feature from the core game.

**SUMMARY**
What the code does is go on the trading page of the site and bump trades every 15 minutes for other players to see instead of the user having to manually bump the trades.
